        <p>  Warzone is a battle royale where there are more than 120+ players who fight against each other and try to win the match by being the last man standing.
         your guns must be quipped with the right attachments. To get the right attachments you must level up your gun in multiplayer or through
        battle royale mode.Warzone can be played in one of two ways:

            For Modern Warfare owners: Warzone appears as another game mode option in the Main Menu between Multiplayer and Co-Op.

            For Non-Modern Warfare owners: A version of Modern Warfare that provides access to only the Warzone portion can be downloaded separately from Modern Warfare as a free-to-play experience on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Games Store, or the Battle.net App (PC).</p>

        <p> Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. The story takes place in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe. This was the most hyped game of the decade, thought it did not meet its expectation
        , it did make an impact in the modern day world with its stunning next gen graphics and AI controlled storyline where each and every action will lead to a mission that is completely different for some other person who is als playing the game.
            The game will be significantly better when you play it way later. Unless you want to be part of the "hype" and discuss the game while it is still new, simply wait. It isn't worth it right now.</p>

        <p>Valheim is a brutal exploration and survival game for 1-10 players, set in a procedurally-generated purgatory inspired by viking culture. Battle, build, and conquer your way to a saga worthy of Odin’s patronage! If you have played minecraft before and you have enjoyed that before than you will for sure
        enjoy this game as well. It is packed with adventures in land and sea. The exploration is quite vast and player can even tame animals to aid them in their adventure.Playing Valheim, you're thrust into a huge procedurally generated world that's inspired by Norse mythology and is essentially Viking purgatory. Your mission is to find and kill Odin's enemies and bring order to the realm of Velheim.</p>

        <p>Valorant is pvp game where player fight in a map 5v5, each player hsa their own abilities and perks. All they have to do is kill all the enemy players or complete the objective of the game-mode.Like, one team starts as the Attackers and one team starts as the Defenders, and after 12 rounds, the two teams switch sides. The Attackers’ goal is to plant a bomb (called the Spike) on one of several bomb sites around the map. The Defenders’ job is to, well, defend, either by defusing the Spike after it’s planted, or preventing the Attackers from planting the Spike within the round’s time limit. Either team can also win a round by eliminating the other team, as there are no respawns during a round. </p>
